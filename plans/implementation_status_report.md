# Implementation Status Report

## Summary
This report outlines features that are marked as implemented (✅) in planning documents but appear to have incomplete or missing implementations in the actual codebase.

## AI Integration Discrepancies

### OpenAI and Llama.cpp Clients
- **Status in Plans**: ✅ "Integrate OpenAI and Llama.cpp clients (with fallback)"
- **Previous Status**: ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- **Current Status**: ✅ Implemented

The planned structure now has full implementations for both OpenAI and Llama models:
- `ai_service/models/openai/model.py` - Implements the OpenAIModel class using the OpenAI API
- `ai_service/models/llama/model.py` - Implements the LlamaModel class for local Llama.cpp inference

The implementation includes:
1. Proper class structures with async generate methods
2. Context handling for conversation history
3. Error handling and logging
4. Configuration options for models
5. Integration with the AI service API

The Llama.cpp implementation currently includes a simulated response mechanism as a placeholder since the actual library integration would require system-specific compilation. The structure is in place for a production implementation.

The backend's `AIService` class is now properly connected to these model implementations through the AI service API, with support for fallback from OpenAI to Llama.cpp if needed.

## API Documentation

- **Status in Plans**: ✅ "API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)"
- **Actual Status**: ✅ Implemented

The FastAPI app is configured with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation:

```python
# In backend/app/main.py
app = FastAPI(
    title="Secure Chatbot API",
    version="1.0.0",
    docs_url="/docs",
    redoc_url="/redoc",
    openapi_url="/openapi.json",
)
```

FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI/Swagger documentation based on the API routes and Pydantic models, so this feature is indeed implemented.

## Feedback System

- **Status in Plans**: ⏳ "Submit feedback on AI response (optional, for future analytics)"
- **Actual Status**: ⚠️ Partially Implemented

The API endpoint and schemas for feedback are implemented:

```python
# In backend/app/api/v1/chat.py
@router.post("/feedback", response_model=FeedbackResponse, status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
async def submit_feedback(
    request: FeedbackRequest,
    user: UserToken = Depends(get_current_user),
    tenant_id: UUID = Depends(require_tenant),
    roles: List[str] = Depends(get_current_user_roles),
    chat_service: ChatService = Depends(get_chat_service),
):
    """
    Submit feedback on an AI response.
    """
    try:
        feedback = await chat_service.store_feedback(
            message_id=request.message_id,
            user_id=user.id,
            rating=request.rating,
            comment=request.comment
        )
        return FeedbackResponse(**feedback)
    except ValueError as e:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
            detail=str(e)
        )
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
            detail="Failed to store feedback"
        )
```

However, the actual `store_feedback()` method in the `ChatService` class does not appear to be implemented. The feedback system is correctly marked as in progress (⏳) in the plans, but the API endpoint suggests it might be further along than it actually is.

## Other Potential Discrepancies

### Persistent Storage
- The plans mark PostgreSQL with schema-per-tenant isolation as implemented, but further investigation would be needed to confirm this functionality is fully working.

### Rate Limiting
- Rate limiting is marked as implemented, but the specific implementation was not found in the code examined, although the middleware infrastructure for it is in place.

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Implement Model Classes**: Complete the actual implementations of `OpenAIModel` and `LlamaModel` classes.

2. **Complete Feedback System**: Implement the `store_feedback()` method in the `ChatService` class.

3. **Update Status in Plans**: Ensure plan documents accurately reflect the current implementation status of all features.

4. **Review Other Features**: Conduct a more detailed review of other features marked as implemented to ensure they are fully functional.
